# PRA3006-Programming-in-the-Life-Sciences
This repository contains our submission for PILS, PRA3006 at maastricht university.
Our project was meant to serve as a diagnostic tool for healthcare professionals who may be presented with patients who consume illegal drugs.
When a patient presents themselves and requires care for a condition, care must be taken to ensure that there is no interaction
between prescribed medication and any other substances the patient may be taking.
Our goal was to solve this problem by querying drug pathways and showing which drugs possibly interact based on their pathway,
creating a visualized network of interacting drugs and presenting a table of drugs which should be safe to prescribed, as they act on a different pathway



***THIS WAS NOT MADE BY HEALTHCARE OR PHARMACOLOGY PROFESSIONALS, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT AS ANYTHING MORE THAN A PROOF OF CONCEPT
ALWAYS CONSULT YOUR REAL DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR MEDICATION***


In short, this code is relativley simple to understand and run, download the contents of the Final Project directory onto your machine within a single folder, and
open index.html, where you will be greeted with a short message explaining the purpose of this project, and a dropdown menu.
The dropdown box on the left lets you select a condition that you wish to prescribe medication for, and the dropdown box
on the right lets you select an illicit drug that the person you wish to prescribe the medication to has taken/is taking.
Click search, and you will see a network of all the drugs used to treat the condition alongside the illicit drug, all
drugs in this network share a pathway through the body, and as such are at risk for interaction. Underneath
there should(if we've had time to implement it) a table which will be a list of all the drugs which should be safe to prescribe 
to treat the condition, and should not result in any unwanted side effects from interaction
as stated above, this is not a replacement for asking your doctor
